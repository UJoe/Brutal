# Brutal
My first HTML-CSS-JS creation: an exciting role-play game in a brutal world. It has 3 parts: a dungeon-based development stage, an easy-to-use webshop to buy weapons, armor and special objects and the board-game-like final battle. 100% my code. It also demonstrates my development from an absolute beginner to a bit better programmer - but you can play the game well at any stage, and your character has a continuous development. Have fun! (Currently it works perfectly on a wide PC monitor. Optimization for other screens is expected later.)
I'd code lots of things differently now, but it was fun how I tried using the basic commands I'd just learned immediately to create a game.
